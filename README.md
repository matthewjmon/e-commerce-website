# E-Commerce Website

A **static e-commerce website** built during my Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. This project demonstrates my ability to create interactive, user-friendly web applications with persistent functionality and offline support.

## Project Overview
This e-commerce site allows users to browse products, add items to a shopping cart, and save preferences for a personalized experience. It highlights front-end interactivity, persistent storage, and progressive web app features.

## Key Features
- **Add-to-Cart Functionality:** Users can add and remove products from their cart.  
- **Persistent Cart:** Shopping cart data is saved using LocalStorage to maintain items across sessions.  
- **User Preferences:** Saves user settings, such as name and currency, for a personalized experience.  
- **Offline Access:** Implements Service Workers to enable basic offline functionality.  
- **Responsive Design:** Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for cross-device compatibility.  
- **Interactive Experience:** Uses JavaScript to manage dynamic UI interactions.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling)  
- Service Workers (offline support)  
- LocalStorage & Cookies (persistent data)

## Purpose
This project was created to practice building a **fully interactive front-end application** and applying responsive design principles. It demonstrates my ability to manage **state, storage, and user interactivity** without a backend.
